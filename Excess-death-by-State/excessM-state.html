        <p> Estimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods. These charts provide the average estimates of excess deaths by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred, from the 11th week of 2020 until year-end. Weekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.</p>

        <h2>What is in this site?</h2>
        <p>This website goes beyond basic case counts to understand the behavior of COVID-19 across different states in the US. We believe that case counts and official COVID-19 deaths are useful to identify outbreaks. However, these figures fail to identify how lethal the virus is with respect to other diseases because they: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't account for non-tested individuals</li>
            <li>Don't account for non-covid preventable deaths at overloaded hospitals</li>
        </ul> 
         <p> Thus, case and death counts confound the effectiveness of policies across different geographies. For this reason, epidemiologists analyze Excess Mortality: how much more deaths per month occured during the pandemic, compared to an average year for each state (Our World in Data, 2020).</p>

        <p>We are a group of highly motivated policy students who believe in the power of evidence to analyze and recommend policy. In this site, we want to share this enthusiasm and give you some facts to better understand what is happening and what should be done. </p>

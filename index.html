         <h2>What is in this site?</h2>
         <p>This website goes beyond basic case counts to understand the behavior of COVID-19 across different states in the US. We believe that case counts and official COVID-19 deaths are useful to identify outbreaks. However, these figures fail to identify how lethal the virus is with respect to other diseases because COVID-19 case and death tolls: </p>
         <ul>
            <li><i><b>Don't account for non-tested individuals</b></i></li>
            <li><i><b>Don't account for non-covid preventable deaths at overloaded hospitals</b></i></li>
         </ul> 
         <p> These figures confound the effectiveness of policies across different geographies. For this reason, epidemiologists analyze Excess Mortality: how much more deaths per month occured during the pandemic, compared to an average year for each state. For more information, you can click <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid">here</a>.</p>

         <h1 style="text-align:center"> <br>Excess Deaths by State </h1>

         <p> Estimates of excess deaths provide information about the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Excess deaths from COVID-19 are:<b>the difference between the observed number of deaths on a week during the pandemic and before the pandemic</b>.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>The map provides the average number of excess deaths in each state per 100 thousand people. We compare the average number of weekly deaths per 100 thousand people between the 11th week and the last week of 2020, with the average number for those weeks during 5 years prior to the pandemic.</p>

         <p><u>Note: reporting deaths per 100 thousand people allows comparing between population sizes.</u> That is: it allows comparing excess mortality between a very populous and a sparsely populated state.</p>

         <p>In the map, <b>states with the darkest colors have the greatest rise in deaths since the pandemic was declared</b>. Hover over the map to see the figure for each state.</p>

         <p><b>Example of how to read the figures</b>: since the start of the pandemic, there have been on average more than 4 additional weekly deaths in Texas, compared to weekly deaths in the last 5 years.</p>

        <p>To get the intuition behind excess mortality, we compared excess deaths in the state of New York to those reported as caused by Covid.  We see that in the peak of the pandemic, excess deaths almost doubled, suggesting that the death toll caused by Covid was far greater than the figures reported. The spread later on becomes smaller as testing revamped and the health facilities became less overcrowded.</p>

         <iframe title="During the peak in New York, from the 12th to the 16th week of the year, excess deaths exceeded the reported Covid death toll" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-RSD7Z" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RSD7Z/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="900"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();

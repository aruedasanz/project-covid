         <h2 style="text-align:center"> <br>  Beyond Case-Counts: Excess deaths provide a deeper understanding of COVID-19 in America </h1>

         <p>This website goes beyond basic case counts to understand the behavior of COVID-19 across different states in the US. We believe that case counts and official COVID-19 deaths are useful to identify outbreaks. However, these figures fail to identify how lethal the virus is with respect to other diseases because COVID-19 case and death tolls: </p>
         <ul>
            <li><i>Don't account for non-tested individuals</i></li>
            <li><i>Don't account for non-covid preventable deaths at overloaded hospitals</i></li>
         </ul> 
         <p> These figures confound the effectiveness of policies across different geographies. For this reason, epidemiologists analyze Excess Mortality: how much more deaths per month occured during the pandemic, compared to an average year for each state. For more information, you can click <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid">here</a>.</p>

         <h3>Navigating through this site</h3>

         <p>Below, we provide an overview of excess death figures by state. We also show how this figure is more effective than COVID-19 cases and death tolls at explaining the health effects of the pandemic.</p>

         <h2 style="text-align:center"> <br>Excess Deaths by State </h2>

         <p> Estimates of excess deaths provide information about the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Excess deaths from COVID-19 are:<b>the difference between the observed number of deaths on a week during the pandemic and before the pandemic</b>.</li>
         </ul>

<!--Added these portions to datawrapper
         <p>The map provides the average number of excess deaths in each state per 100 thousand people. We compare the average number of weekly deaths per 100 thousand people between the 11th week and the last week of 2020, with the average number for those weeks during 5 years prior to the pandemic.</p>

         <p><u>Note: reporting deaths per 100 thousand people allows comparing between population sizes.</u> That is: it allows comparing excess mortality between a very populous and a sparsely populated state.</p>

         <p>In the map, <b>states with the darkest colors have the greatest rise in deaths since the pandemic was declared</b>. Hover over the map to see the figure for each state.</p>

         <p><b>Example of how to read the figures</b>: since the start of the pandemic, there have been on average more than 4 additional weekly deaths in Texas, compared to weekly deaths in the last 5 years.</p> -->

        <p>In the map, we are calculating a weekly average for each state. This average doesn't account for different circumstances in each state. For instance, while the average excess mortality in New York is similar to North Dakota, it is worth noting the peak occurred at different months. In New York, the peak in excess deaths occurred in the first months of the pandemic, while in North Dakota, this happened later. These differences occurred because while New York is more connected to international travel, it struck earlier than in North Dakota.</p>

        <p><b>Intuition behind excess mortality</b>: we compared excess deaths in the state of New York to those reported as caused by COVID-19.  At the peak of the pandemic, excess deaths were almost twice the reported COVID-19 deaths. The difference suggests the death toll caused by COVID-19 was far greater than the figures reported. The spread later on becomes smaller as policy reacted with: revamped testing, lockdown measures and as health facilities became less overcrowded.</p> -->

        <h2>Top 10 US States with the Highest Excess Deaths per Capita</h2>

        <p> The tables exhibit the average excess death per week normalized by 100,000 people. This allows comparing the performance of the state managing the pandemic against the rest. The states which were more adversely affected by the pandemic by this metric were the District of Columbia, North Dakota and New York. On the contrary, the states which managed better the pandemic according to this metric were West Virginia, North Carolina and Hawaii. An interesting case arises in West Virginia, which exhibits a negative coefficient, which might suggest that the casualties prevented by the decline in mobility stemming from lockdown measures actually exceeded those caused by Covid-19.</p>

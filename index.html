        <h1> Beyond case-counts: understanding the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>

        <h2>What is in this site?</h2>
        <p>This website goes beyond basic case counts to understand the behavior of COVID-19 across different states in the US. We believe that case counts and official COVID-19 deaths are useful to identify outbreaks. However, these figures fail to identify how lethal the virus is with respect to other diseases because they: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't account for non-tested individuals</li>
            <li>Don't account for non-covid preventable deaths at overloaded hospitals</li>
        </ul> 
         <p> Thus, case and death counts confound the effectiveness of policies across different geographies. For this reason, epidemiologists analyze Excess Mortality: how much more deaths per month occured during the pandemic, compared to an average year for each state (Our World in Data, 2020).</p>

    <link href="Excess-death-by-State/scatter-style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></link>

        <p>Now lets check some variables associated with the differences in Excess Deaths across states.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center"> <br>Excess Deaths and Strictness of Measures (Stringency Index)</h1>
        <p>Oxford's COVID-19 Government Response Tracker aims to <b>track and compare worldwide government responses to the coronavirus with a comparable metric</b>. The index collects information on common policy responses and score the stringency of each measure through a comparison to normal times. The scores compount into an overall COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index.</p> 

        <p>This composite measure is a simple additive score of the seven indicators, rescaled to 0 to 100. A score of 0 would be policies in normal times and 100 is the highest level of restrictions. <b>This measure is for comparative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a rating of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country's response</b>. More information about the index can be found here https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/</p>

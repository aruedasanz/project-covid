        <p>Now lets check some variables associated with the differences in Excess Deaths across states.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center"> <br>Excess Deaths and Strictness of Measures (Stringency Index)</h1>
        <p>Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker aims to track and compare worldwide government responses to the coronavirus rigorously and consistently. They collect information on common policy responses, scores the stringency of such measures, and aggregate them into a COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index. This composite measure is a simple additive score of the seven indicators (S1-S7) measured on an ordinal scale, rescaled to vary from 0 to 100. This measure is for comparative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a rating of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country's response. More information about the index can be found here https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/</p>

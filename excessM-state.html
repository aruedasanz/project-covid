        <h1 style="text-align:center"> <br>  Excess Mortality by State </h1>

         <p> Estimates of excess deaths provide information about the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19.</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Excess deaths from COVID-19 are:<b>the difference between the observed number of deaths on a week during the pandemic and before the pandemic</b>.</li>
        </ul>

       <p>The map provides the average number of excess deaths in each state per 100 thousand people. We compare the average number of weekly deaths per 100 thousand people between the 11th week and the last week of 2020, with the average number for those weeks during 5 years prior to the pandemic.</p>

       <p><u>Note: reporting deaths per 100 thousand people allows comparing between population sizes.</u> That is: it allows comparing excess mortality between a very populous and a sparsely populated state.</p>

       <p>In the map, <b>states with the darkest colors have the greatest rise in deaths since the pandemic was declared</b>. Hover over the map to see the figure for each state.</p>

       <p><b>Example of how to read the figures</b>: since the start of the pandemic, there have been on average more than 4 additional weekly deaths in Texas, compared to weekly deaths in the last 5 years.</p>

        <iframe title="Southern and Mid-west States have suffered the most excess deaths" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-shW4Q" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/shW4Q/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="541"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
